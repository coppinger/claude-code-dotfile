# Workflow

Check things into git often (there's an agent for this!)

Use Browserbase MCP to visually inspect the app when helpful. Use ngrok to create a tunnel to the local dev server for Browserbase access.

# Code Style

Write comments in the code

Front-end only, as we're building a demo to explore the product idea and design, which we'll later use to think about and plan the proper architecture etc.  Use .json for mock data/APIs

# AI Usage

Use Claude's Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5 is the model string)

Don't worry about AI API costs — if multiple calls improve quality, use them
